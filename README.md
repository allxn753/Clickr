# Clickr
ICS3U Culminating | Clicking game created by using pygame.

Using Python 3, I created a game where you need to click circles that appear at random places while avoiding a red dot from touching your cursor. You only have 30 seconds to click as many circles as you can. This game stores and sorts highscores (number of circles clicked and accuracy %) so that the user can refer to them later. There is also a tutorial mode for the user to practice before entering the real game. If the user has a friend over, they can also play by using multiplayer where users go against eachother competing on who can get the best score.
